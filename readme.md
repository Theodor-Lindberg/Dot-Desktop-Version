# Dot Desktop Version
This is my project for the course *Object Oriented Programming and Java* (TDDE30).  
## About  
Dot Desktop Version is inspired by [Dot][dot]. Dot is a 2D game where the player tries to get to the end, but to get there the player must solve puzzles and avoid enemies. Dot Desktop Version will be the same as Dot but with a few different features and will be run on the desktop and not in the browser.
